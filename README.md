### Instance Swap Not Working
**Possible causes:**
- Component name in CSV doesn't match any component in Figma
- Check spelling and exact component name (case-insensitive but must match)
- Component might be in a different page - plugin searches all pages
- Ensure the property type is INSTANCE_SWAP (not TEXT or VARIANT)
- Check console logs to see what components are being searched

**Debug steps:**
1. Open console: Plugins ‚Üí Development ‚Üí Open Console
2. Look for "Looking for component with name" messages
3. Verify component exists with exact name in Figma
4. Try using the component name exactly as it appears in layers panel### Instance Swap Handling

The plugin supports instance swap properties for dynamic component replacement:

**How It Works:**
- CSV value contains the name of a component to swap to
- Plugin searches the entire Figma document for a component with that name
- Component name matching is case-insensitive
- Perfect for icons, avatars, illustrations, badges, etc.

**Example:**
```csv
Name,Icon,Avatar
John,shapes,profile-male
Jane,share,profile-female  
Bob,sheet,profile-default
```

**Requirements:**
- Components must exist in your Figma file (any page)
- Component names in CSV must match Figma component names
- Works with both regular components and component sets

**Common Use Cases:**
- **Icons** - Swap different icon components (shapes, share, settings, etc.)
- **Avatars** - Swap different avatar/profile images
- **Illustrations** - Change illustrations based on context
- **Badges** - Swap different badge/label designs
- **Status Indicators** - Different visual indicators per state### Variant Value Handling

The plugin intelligently handles variant properties:

**Direct Matching:**
- CSV value matches variant option name exactly (case-insensitive)
- Example: CSV "online" ‚Üí Variant option "online"

**Boolean to Yes/No Conversion:**
- For variants with "yes"/"no" options, boolean-style values are auto-converted
- `true`, `1`, `on`, `enabled`, `active` ‚Üí "yes"
- `false`, `0`, `off`, `disabled`, `inactive` ‚Üí "no"
- Perfect for variants like "Active=yes/no", "Visible=yes/no", etc.

**Example:**
```csv
Name,Active,Status
John,true,online    # Active variant becomes "yes", Status becomes "online"
Jane,false,away     # Active variant becomes "no", Status becomes "away"
```### Nested Components

The plugin automatically traverses and updates nested component instances. If your main component contains other component instances, their properties will also be updated based on CSV column names.

**Example:**
- Main component has a nested "Badge" component with a boolean property "Visible"
- CSV column "Visible" with values `true`/`false` will control the badge visibility
- All matching property names across the component hierarchy are updated# Conveyor - Figma Plugin

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Installation

1. Download or clone this repository
2. Open **Figma Desktop App**
3. Go to **Plugins** ‚Üí **Development** ‚Üí **Import plugin from manifest**
4. Select the `manifest.json` file from this directory
5. The plugin appears in **Plugins** ‚Üí **Development** ‚Üí **Conveyor**

### Usage

#### 1. Prepare Your Component

Create a Figma component with text and/or boolean properties. Name them to match your CSV column headers.

**Example Component:**
- Text property: `Name`
- Text property: `Email`
- Text property: `Role`
- Boolean property: `Active`
- Variant property: `Status` (with options: "online", "offline", "away")
- Instance swap property: `Icon` (with preferred values: shapes, share, sheet, etc.)

> üí° **Tip:** Component properties (exposed properties) are recommended for easier instance customization.

#### 2. Prepare Your CSV File

Create a CSV file with headers in the first row that match your component property names.

```csv
Name,Email,Role,Active,Status,Icon
John Doe,john@example.com,Designer,true,online,shapes
Jane Smith,jane@example.com,Developer,yes,away,share
Bob Johnson,bob@example.com,Manager,false,offline,sheet
```

**Boolean Values:**
The plugin accepts multiple formats for boolean properties:
- **TRUE:** `true`, `yes`, `1`, `on`, `enabled`, `active` (case-insensitive)
- **FALSE:** `false`, `no`, `0`, `off`, `disabled`, `inactive` (case-insensitive)

**Variant Values:**
For variant properties:
- Use the exact variant option name (e.g., "online", "offline", "away")
- For yes/no variants: Boolean-style values are automatically converted (true‚Üíyes, false‚Üíno)

**Instance Swap Values:**
For instance swap properties (e.g., Icon):
- Use the component name exactly as it appears in Figma (case-insensitive)
- The plugin searches the entire document for matching components
- Perfect for swapping icons, avatars, illustrations, etc.

See `example.csv` for a sample file.

#### 3. Generate Instances

1. Select your component (or an instance of it) in Figma
2. Run the plugin: **Plugins** ‚Üí **Development** ‚Üí **Conveyor**
3. In the **Generate** tab, click **"Select Component"**
4. Switch to the **Data** tab
5. Upload your CSV file (click or drag & drop)
6. Review the data preview
7. Return to the **Generate** tab and click **"Generate Instances"**

Done! üéâ The plugin creates one instance per CSV row with all text content populated.

## üéØ How It Works

The plugin uses intelligent name-based matching:

1. **Component Text Properties** - Text properties are matched with CSV column headers containing text values
2. **Component Boolean Properties** - Boolean properties are matched with CSV column headers containing boolean values
3. **Component Variant Properties** - Variant properties are matched with CSV column headers containing variant option names
4. **Component Instance Swap Properties** - Instance swap properties are matched with CSV column headers containing component names
5. **Nested Component Properties** - Properties in nested component instances are also matched and updated
6. **Text Layer Names** - Text layers in the component are matched with CSV column headers
7. **Case-Insensitive** - Matching works regardless of case (e.g., "active" matches "Active", "shapes" matches "Shapes")
8. **Column Order Independent** - Column order in CSV doesn't matter, only names need to match

### Boolean Value Parsing

The plugin automatically converts string values from CSV to boolean:

**Accepted TRUE values:** `true`, `yes`, `1`, `on`, `enabled`, `active`  
**Accepted FALSE values:** `false`, `no`, `0`, `off`, `disabled`, `inactive`

All values are case-insensitive, so `TRUE`, `True`, and `true` all work.

### Example Mapping

| CSV Column | Component Property | Type | CSV Value | Result |
|------------|-------------------|------|-----------|--------|
| Name | "Name" | TEXT | "John Doe" | ‚úÖ Matched & Updated |
| email | "Email" | TEXT | "john@example.com" | ‚úÖ Matched (case-insensitive) |
| Active | "Active" | BOOLEAN | "yes" | ‚úÖ Converted to true |
| Status | "Status" | VARIANT | "online" | ‚úÖ Matched to variant option |
| Active | "Active" (yes/no variant) | VARIANT | "true" | ‚úÖ Converted to "yes" |
| Icon | "Icon" | INSTANCE_SWAP | "shapes" | ‚úÖ Swapped to shapes component |
| Visible | "Visible" (nested) | BOOLEAN | "true" | ‚úÖ Updated in nested instance |
| State | "Description" | TEXT | "Active" | ‚ùå Not matched (different names) |

## üí° Tips & Best Practices

### For Best Results

1. **Use Component Properties** - Expose text, boolean, variant, and instance swap properties in your component for easier instance management
2. **Name Consistently** - Use the same naming convention in both CSV and component
3. **Boolean Formats** - Use any accepted boolean format (true/false, yes/no, 1/0, etc.)
4. **Variant Values** - Use exact variant option names, or boolean-style values for yes/no variants
5. **Instance Swap** - Use exact component names as they appear in Figma (case-insensitive)
6. **Leverage Nesting** - Use nested components with properties for modular designs
7. **Test with Small Data First** - Try with 2-3 rows before processing large datasets
8. **Keep Backup** - The plugin supports undo (Cmd/Ctrl + Z), but save your work first

### Common Use Cases

- **User Cards** - Generate user profile cards with names, emails, avatars (instance swap), and active status
- **Product Lists** - Create product cards with titles, descriptions, prices, icons (instance swap), and availability flags
- **Team Directories** - Build team member cards with roles, contact info, custom avatars (instance swap), and online status
- **Icon Libraries** - Test icon components by swapping different icons in layouts
- **Feature Flags** - Design UI with toggleable features using nested badge/indicator components
- **A/B Testing** - Create multiple variations of designs with different boolean states and swapped elements
- **Status Indicators** - Generate elements with active/inactive, on/off states in nested components
- **Notification Badges** - Control visibility of nested notification/badge components

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Please select a component first"
**Solution:** Make sure you have a component, component set, or instance selected in Figma before clicking "Select Component"

### Text Not Updating
**Possible causes:**
- Component property/layer names don't match CSV headers
- Check spelling and capitalization (matching is case-insensitive but names must match)
- Ensure CSV file has proper headers in first row
- Verify the component has text properties or text layers

### Boolean Properties Not Updating
**Possible causes:**
- Property in component is not set as BOOLEAN type
- CSV value format not recognized - use: true/false, yes/no, 1/0, on/off, etc.
- Property name doesn't match CSV header (case-insensitive)
- Check that the component property is exposed

### Variant Properties Not Updating
**Possible causes:**
- CSV value doesn't match any variant option (check spelling)
- For yes/no variants: boolean-style values should auto-convert
- Property name doesn't match CSV header (case-insensitive)
- Nested variant might be in a nested instance - ensure it's exposed

### Font Errors
**Solution:** The plugin attempts to load fonts automatically. If you encounter font errors:
- Ensure the fonts used in your component are installed
- Try using standard system fonts
- Check that text layers are not using missing fonts

### Invalid CSV File
**Possible causes:**
- File is not a valid CSV format
- File has formatting issues (unbalanced quotes, etc.)
- Try opening and re-saving the CSV in a spreadsheet application
