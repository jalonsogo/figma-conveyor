## üöÄ Quick Start

### Installation

1. Download or clone this repository
2. Open **Figma Desktop App**
3. Go to **Plugins** ‚Üí **Development** ‚Üí **Import plugin from manifest**
4. Select the `manifest.json` file from this directory
5. The plugin appears in **Plugins** ‚Üí **Development** ‚Üí **CSV Instance Generator**

### Usage

#### 1. Prepare Your Component

Create a Figma component with text properties or text layers. Name them to match your CSV column headers.

**Example Component:**
- Text property/layer: `Name`
- Text property/layer: `Email`
- Text property/layer: `Role`
- Text property/layer: `Status`

> üí° **Tip:** Component text properties (exposed properties) are recommended for easier instance customization.

#### 2. Prepare Your CSV File

Create a CSV file with headers in the first row that match your component property/layer names.

```csv
Name,Email,Role,Status
John Doe,john@example.com,Designer,Active
Jane Smith,jane@example.com,Developer,Active
Bob Johnson,bob@example.com,Manager,Inactive
Alice Williams,alice@example.com,Designer,Active
```

See `example.csv` for a sample file.

#### 3. Generate Instances

1. Select your component (or an instance of it) in Figma
2. Run the plugin: **Plugins** ‚Üí **Development** ‚Üí **CSV Instance Generator**
3. In the **Generate** tab, click **"Select Component"**
4. Switch to the **Data** tab
5. Upload your CSV file (click or drag & drop)
6. Review the data preview
7. Return to the **Generate** tab and click **"Generate Instances"**

Done! üéâ The plugin creates one instance per CSV row with all text content populated.

## üéØ How It Works

The plugin uses intelligent name-based matching:

1. **Component Text Properties** - If your component has exposed text properties, they're matched with CSV column headers
2. **Text Layer Names** - Text layers in the component are matched with CSV column headers
3. **Case-Insensitive** - Matching works regardless of case (e.g., "name" matches "Name")
4. **Column Order Independent** - Column order in CSV doesn't matter, only names need to match

### Example Mapping

| CSV Column | Component Property/Layer | Result |
|------------|-------------------------|---------|
| Name | "Name" | ‚úÖ Matched |
| email | "Email" | ‚úÖ Matched (case-insensitive) |
| ROLE | "Role" | ‚úÖ Matched (case-insensitive) |
| Status | "Description" | ‚ùå Not matched (different names) |

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

- **API Version:** Figma Plugin API 1.0.0
- **No Network Access** - All processing is local
- **Supported Node Types:** Components, component sets, instances
- **Font Handling:** Automatic font loading for text updates
- **CSV Parsing:** Handles quoted values, commas in fields, empty cells

## üìù CSV Format Requirements

- First row must contain column headers
- Headers should match component text property/layer names (case-insensitive)
- Supports quoted values with commas: `"Last, First"`
- Empty cells are supported and will be skipped
- UTF-8 encoding recommended

## üí° Tips & Best Practices

### For Best Results

1. **Use Component Text Properties** - Expose text properties in your component for easier instance management
2. **Name Consistently** - Use the same naming convention in both CSV and component
3. **Test with Small Data First** - Try with 2-3 rows before processing large datasets
4. **Keep Backup** - The plugin supports undo (Cmd/Ctrl + Z), but save your work first

### Common Use Cases

- **User Cards** - Generate user profile cards with names, emails, avatars
- **Product Lists** - Create product cards with titles, descriptions, prices
- **Team Directories** - Build team member cards with roles and contact info
- **Data Visualization** - Populate charts and graphs with real data
- **A/B Testing** - Create multiple variations of designs quickly

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Please select a component first"
**Solution:** Make sure you have a component, component set, or instance selected in Figma before clicking "Select Component"

### Text Not Updating
**Possible causes:**
- Component property/layer names don't match CSV headers
- Check spelling and capitalization (matching is case-insensitive but names must match)
- Ensure CSV file has proper headers in first row
- Verify the component has text properties or text layers

### Font Errors
**Solution:** The plugin attempts to load fonts automatically. If you encounter font errors:
- Ensure the fonts used in your component are installed
- Try using standard system fonts
- Check that text layers are not using missing fonts

### Invalid CSV File
**Possible causes:**
- File is not a valid CSV format
- File has formatting issues (unbalanced quotes, etc.)
- Try opening and re-saving the CSV in a spreadsheet application
